# sql-project-and-learning
All my projects and self-learning related to SQL

This is how I learned SQL in very basic (let's say my learning diary)

## 1. Read all documentation
Well, I don't read it at all. Here's the website I use to learn at least understand and know the syntax from the basics of SQL. 
1. https://www.w3schools.com/sql
2. YouTube (If you prefered see the progress in real time when you still don't understand on your hands-on trial in W3)
3. All AI (I'm just using this to ensure my logic can be applied in SQL)

## 2. SQL Games
At first, I tried to learning all at once, but the result is not effective. I want to join the bootcamp, but I'm afraid I will not understand what the mentor says. So I tried this method. Turns out, it's worked. 

## 3. Tried to draw it
This is the easier way to understand what your problem is and how to connect the dots between each table. We call it ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram). An ERD is similar to a mind map, but it only contains tables with data headers and data types. Rather than thinking logically about how to solve a problem, it's easier to draw the lines you need to solve the problem, helping you better understand what you're trying to create or find the most effective solution.

## 4. Trying Join Competition 
Taking part in a competition is a challenge you need if you have at least a basic understanding of SQL. Participating in a competition challenges you to find effective ways to retrieve and process data within a limited time. You'll also discover unique case studies with data rarely found on other websites.
